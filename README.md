<b>Test Klen-Secure-2</b>

Klen-Secure is an npm module that provides backend route security.  This is a piece of extremely slightly modified
boilerplate (from Boilermaker), to eventually test the functionality of the second version of klen-secure, which will be slicker, provide more information in the auth fail log, and be compatible with Koa.
